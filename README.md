# MGCN-CalRF
From each dataset among six different modalities the edges have been established among the samples. We have used pearson correlation for this. It is done in graphdatapreprocessing.py.
For single modality combinations the classification code is available in GCNCalRF_1combo.py. 
Required Pythoh version 3.7. Detailed software requirements are given in the 'software requirement.txt' file.
