# MGCN-CalRF
Edges have been established among the samples in each dataset from six different modalities. Pearson correlation has been used for this purpose, implemented in graphdatapreprocessing.py. The classification code for single modality combinations is available in MGCN_CALRF1.py. Similarly, MGCN_CALRF2.py through MGCN_CALRF6.py execute experiments for two through six modality combinations, respectively. Python version 3.7 is required. Detailed software requirements are provided in the 'software requirement.txt' file. For any queries regarding the code and data, please contact susmitapalmal11@gmail.com.
